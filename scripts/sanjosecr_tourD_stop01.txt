Alright—museum mode. We’re at the Museo del Jade, and I want you to do one thing before we even look at an object: lower your speed. Museums punish rushing. This one rewards slow curiosity, because the story here is older than the city outside, older than the Spanish language on the street signs, older than the idea of Costa Rica as a country.

What you’re seeing—depending on where you’re standing—is a modern building holding ancient materials. Jade is the headline, but the deeper story is human intention. The irreversible historical moment behind these galleries is the formation of complex Indigenous societies in the region, long before Europeans arrived. People built trade networks, spiritual systems, artistic languages. They were not “pre-history.” They were history—just not written in European ink.

Named humans are difficult here because the past doesn’t always preserve individual names. So the “named community” is the answer: the Indigenous peoples of Costa Rica and Central America who shaped these objects and lived with them. Their stakes were survival, status, spirituality, identity—everything that still matters now.

Small grounding detail: jade has weight. Even small pieces feel dense in your imagination, like a decision. These objects were carried, worn, passed down. They touched skin. They witnessed ceremonies.

Insider tip: don’t try to see everything equally. Choose a handful of pieces and let them teach you. Look for animal forms—birds, jaguars—because those aren’t decorations; they’re symbols of power and worldview.

Fun fact: jade was often more valuable than gold in many Mesoamerican cultures. That flips the conquest narrative on its head.

If you remember one thing, remember this: this museum isn’t about “old things.” It’s about living people in the past—people who made art not to impress you, but to make sense of their world.
