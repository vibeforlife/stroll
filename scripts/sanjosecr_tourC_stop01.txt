Take a deep breath—this is La Sabana, San José’s “lungs.” You feel it right away: more sky, more space, a softer horizon. Downtown can be tight and busy, but here the city stretches out like it’s finally exhaling. People jog, walk dogs, kick a ball, sit under trees with iced drinks and big plans.

What you’re seeing is an urban park with layers. It’s not just grass. It’s memory. The irreversible historical moment here is that La Sabana was once an airport—Costa Rica’s first main international airport sat right in this park area before flights moved elsewhere. Imagine that: where you’re walking now, planes used to take off. The park literally traded speed for breath.

Named humans matter: pilots, travelers, workers, and later city planners and communities who reclaimed the space for public life. The stakes are civic—this is land in a capital city. Turning it into a park is a choice that says, “We want life to be livable.”

Cultural consequence: La Sabana became a shared backyard. A place where social classes overlap. You’ll see families picnicking, athletes training, couples wandering. The park becomes a national mood board—active, relaxed, communal.

Small grounding detail: notice the way people move here compared to downtown. The shoulders drop. The walking pace widens. The city’s tension loosens.

Insider tip: if you want to join locals, do a slow loop walk and stop for fresh fruit or a cold drink from a vendor. And if you’re here near sunset, the light turns the park into something almost cinematic—gold on the grass, silhouettes of palm trees, that “okay, I get why people love this” feeling.

Fun fact: many cities have central parks, but not many have parks with “former airport” energy. La Sabana carries that strange blend of openness and history.

If you remember one thing, remember this: La Sabana is San José choosing breathable life over endless development. It’s the city’s reminder that progress isn’t only building more—it’s also leaving room.
